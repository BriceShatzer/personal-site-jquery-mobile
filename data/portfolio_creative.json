Numerous activities like hunting, ATV trails, dog training and model airplanes/rocketry all take place within this space. This popularity has lead to altercations between groups of park goers, so we were tasked with creating signage which not only conveyed the diverse array of actives which take place, but also reminding visitors to be considerate to others also using the space.</p><p>I was responsible for creating more literal representation of the various activities that take place to contrast the more minimalistic iconography used in our other designs. Each activity image was created as an independent vector image in Adobe Illustrator before being composited together in Adobe InDesign.</p><p> This project was was presented at \"<a href='https://designconference.aiga.org/' target='_blank'>Head, Heart, Hand: AIGA Design Conference 2013</a>\" by Prof. Laura Rodman Huaracha in her talk \"Utilizing interdisciplinary heads; Teaching the visualization of ecological and conservation issues\"</p>",
